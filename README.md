A tool to build Nintendo Switch homebrew games using GameMaker Studio 2's runtime.

```
burned here

This is the Source Code for the Latest Version of RussellNX/KittyNXBuilder that I know exists: v1.6.3a
Build will be in Releases in due time
Wiki might be recreated as well
```

If you have no idea how to use `switch_` GMS 2 functions, feel free to visit the [KittyNXBuilder Wiki.](https://github.com/burnedpopcorn/RussellNX-REUPLOAD/wiki) (no NDA or devkit required)

Please don't ask for `prod.keys` file, you must dump it yourself from your own Switch. Oh, and make sure you dump it via "Lockpick-RCM" and not the regular "Lockpick" (if possible).
